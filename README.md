# **ArchSec Atlas**

*A Personal Map of Mastery in Systems & Security*

---

## Overview

**ArchSec Atlas** is a framework I designed for my own long-term growth in **systems and security expertise**.
It is **not** a single technical project—rather, it is a structured, continuously expanding **learning roadmap + lab collection + knowledge repository**.

The metaphor of an *Atlas* reflects that:

* it is not a linear course
* but a continuous process of exploration, expansion, and charting the unknown
* and it grows with time, becoming my personal understanding of the systems-security landscape

This Atlas collects and organizes my long-term practice across **five major directions**:

1. Reverse Engineering + CTF + Bug Bounty
2. Operating Systems
3. Safe Programming Languages & Compilers (Rust, OCaml, LLVM)
4. LLM × System Security
5. Heterogeneous Architecture & Security (GPU/NPU)

---

## Philosophy

ArchSec Atlas is built upon several principles:

### **1. Learn by Practice**

Every direction is driven by runnable labs, small projects, and experiments.

### **2. Build a Personal Worldview**

Not for exams, not a fixed curriculum, but a holistic security perspective that connects:

**architecture → compiler → OS kernel → binary → vulnerability**

### **3. Keep It Modular**

Each domain has its own repository, while the Atlas acts as the **central navigation hub**.

### **4. Continuous Evolution**

Weekly updates, monthly reviews, and ongoing restructuring as my skills and interests evolve.

# Five Directions (with sub-repositories)

The links below refer to sub-repos that I will gradually create.
For now they serve as placeholders for future labs and experiments.

---

## 1. Reverse Engineering + CTF + Bug Bounty

> Focus: RE, pwn, binary vulnerabilities, and real-world exploit development.
> Includes writeups, ROP labs, heap labs, crackmes, and bug bounty reports.

**Sub-repos:**

* 🔗 `reverse-labs`
* 🔗 `pwn-labs`
* 🔗 `ctf-writeups`

**Atlas document:**
`directions/reverse.md`

---

## 2. Operating Systems

> From xv6 and Linux kernel to memory management, scheduling, system calls, and kernel-level security.

**Sub-repos:**

* 🔗 `os-labs`
* 🔗 `kernel-labs`
* 🔗 `xv6-playground`

**Atlas document:**
`directions/os.md`

---

## 3. Safe Programming Languages & Compilers

> Rust (ownership/unsafe), OCaml (parser/AST), LLVM (IR/Pass/Sanitizer)

**Sub-repos:**

* 🔗 `compiler-labs`
* 🔗 `rust-unsafe-labs`
* 🔗 `llvm-pass-labs`

**Atlas document:**
`directions/compilers.md`

---

## 4. LLM × System Security

> LLM attacks & defenses, red-teaming, AI-assisted RE, automated static analysis

**Sub-repos:**

* 🔗 `llm-security-labs`
* 🔗 `llm-assisted-re`
* 🔗 `jailbreak-labs`

**Atlas document:**
`directions/llm-security.md`

---

## 5. Heterogeneous Architecture & Security (GPU/NPU)

> CUDA GPU security, NPU memory model, IOCTL analysis, accelerator attack surfaces

**Sub-repos:**

* 🔗 `hetero-security-labs`
* 🔗 `gpu-memory-labs`
* 🔗 `npu-security-labs`

**Atlas document:**
`directions/hetero.md`

# How to Use ArchSec Atlas

1. **Every direction is practice-first.**
   Code > Docs > Videos.

2. **Use the smallest possible learning unit.**
   One lab per day, 1–3 hours per unit.

3. **Write logs and reflections.**
   Tracking growth turns the Atlas into an expanding personal knowledge universe.

4. **Continuously refactor your roadmap.**
   Your skills, interests, and goals will change—
   the Atlas should evolve accordingly.
